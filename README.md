# jovian-data-science-projects
The three `.ipynb` files in this repository are my final individual projects from the [Jovian](https://www.jovian.ai/) courses that I've completed (Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas, Data Structures and Algorithms in Python, and Machine Learning with Python: Zero to GBMs). I've also included my certificates from these courses here.

To fully visualize the graphical elements of these `.ipynb` files, you need to open them with the Jupyter Notebook IDE. This is probably most easily done installing [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), although more advanced users might want to look into [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for a smaller and minimalist installation.

If you don't want to install any of that in your system, you can look up these same files already rendered for you in [my profile at Jovian.ai](https://jovian.ai/wagb2b2).
